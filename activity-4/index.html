                    Visual Studio Code is a free code editor that works for many programming languages.
                    Extensions can be installed to easily integrate VS Code with programming
                    languages. This allows VS Code to recognize what syntax rules the code should follow,
                    and VS Code can even build, run, and debug code.

                <p>VS Code is great for keeping all of your programming inside one program, and with the help of extensions, can be on par with IDEs.</p>

                <p>VS Code sucks. It's annoying to have to have to download and cofigure a bunch of stuff just to program. It's good for anything except web development. Just use IDEs from JetBrains like IntelliJ and PyCharm.</p>
