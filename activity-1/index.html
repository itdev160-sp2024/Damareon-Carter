        <h1>Rust Programming Language</h1>
        <h2>What is Rust?</h2>

        <p>Rust is a multi-paradigm, general purpose programming language. Rust has a strong emphasis on:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Performance</li>
            <li>Concurrency</li>
            <li>Type safety</li>
            <li>Memory safety</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p>Rust is a <b>statically-typed language</b>, meaning type safety is checked during compilation instead of<br>while the program is running.</p>
        <p>Rust is a <i>systems programming language</i>, meaning it can be used to write system software such as<br>systems and compilers.</p>
